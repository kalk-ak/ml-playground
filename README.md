# Machine Learning Implementation Repository

This repository contains various implementations and explorations of machine learning concepts and algorithms. It's structured into several subdirectories, each focusing on a specific area.

## Repository Structure:

- **`desicion_tree/`**: Contains implementations related to decision trees and random forests. You'll find core algorithms and testing notebooks here.
- **`Linear_Algebra_Applications/`**: This directory explores applications of linear algebra in machine learning, such as EigenFaces, PageRank, Gaussian Elimination, and QR Factorization.
- **`nlp-playground/`**: **Highly Recommended!** This is a dedicated space for Natural Language Processing (NLP) experiments and implementations. It includes:
    - **`advanced-N-gram-and-log-linear-model/`**: Dive into more complex N-gram models and log-linear models for language processing.
    - **`context-free-grammar/`**: Explore context-free grammars, parsing, and random sentence generation.
    - **`cosine_similarity_and_word_prob/`**: Implementations for calculating cosine similarity and working with word probabilities.
    - **`LLM/`**: Contains resources and code related to Large Language Models, including data, source code for agents, character definitions, dialogue simulations, and evaluation scripts.
    
    Make sure to explore this directory to understand various NLP techniques and models.
- **`sampling/`**: Contains implementations of different sampling techniques, starting with binary sampling.

## Getting Started:

To explore any specific section, navigate into its respective directory. Each directory may contain its own `README.md` or Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) with further explanations and examples.
